TODO
========
- Theme picker/creator in options (separate menu);
- Custom color picker (jtextfield that the background updates to be the color that you've hex typed?)
- Refactor MineButton to remove all statics?
    - Some form of shared state is needed to know:
        - dragging position
        - background color
        - if the click started inside the mine buttons.
        - if the click ended inside the mine buttons.
- Refactor MineButton to simplify rendering.

Bugs
==========
- fix hint to not find flagged squares
    - possible solution is to unprotect the square you are trying to give as a hint
