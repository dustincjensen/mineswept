TODO
========
- Theme picker/creator in options (separate menu);
- Refactor MineButton to remove all statics?
    - Some form of shared state is needed to know:
        - dragging position
        - background color
        - if the click started inside the mine buttons.
        - if the click ended inside the mine buttons.
- Refactor MineButton to simplify rendering.

Working on

Bugs
==========
- fix hint to not find flagged squares
    - possible solution is to unprotect the square you are trying to give as a hint
- Stats window should open over the middle of the window
- About dialog should open over the middle of the window
- Should main window require stats, options and about and subscribe to events to show them?
    - This would solve the problem of the dependency injection and centering the windows over the main window.
