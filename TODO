TODO
========
- Refactor MineButton to remove all statics?
    - Some form of shared state is needed to know:
        - dragging position
        - background color
        - if the click started inside the mine buttons.
        - if the click ended inside the mine buttons.
- Refactor MineButton to simplify rendering.
- Refactor GUI folder
    - rename ui
    - move files around, rename folders
    - better modules
    - move injection module out of ui folder
    - move MineSwept out of UI folder
        - remove MineSwept dependency on JFrame directly.
- Refactor GameState
    - perhaps it is watching too much internally, and should delegate out to separate states 
      and conglomerate them like combineReducers.
- Optimize Bomb clues to be near uncovered spaces.
- Remove unnecessary resources.
- Make Installable

Working on
